# UNIT 1 ASSESSMENT: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. Tip: if you don't know the answer try answering a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

Your answer: an if/else statement. takes values and tells us to print one or the other. or possibly a catch all if none of the first options are true.

Researched answer: Conditional statements are used to perform different actions based on different conditions. very often when you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions.

You can use conditional statements in your code to do this.

In JavaScript we have the following conditional statements:

Use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true
Use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false
Use else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false
Use switch to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: git is the program that allows you to store code and change code. github is the platform where those files are stored where you and other programers can show projects. pull projects and work on them together. 

Researched answer: Git is a version control system that allows developers to track changes in their code. GitHub is a web-based hosting service for git repositories. In simple terms, you can use git without Github, but you cannot use GitHub without Git.

2. What is the difference between an array's index and its value?

Your answer: an arrays index starts counting with 0 indexing which is the computers way of counting. the index is the numbered place the element is at in the array. the value is the actual data. 

Researched answer: In JavaScript, an array's index refers to the position of an element within the array, starting from 0 for the first element, 1 for the second, and so on. The index allows you to access or manipulate specific elements within the array.

On the other hand, an array's value refers to the actual data stored at a particular index within the array. This can be any JavaScript data type, including numbers, strings, objects, or even other arrays.

3. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.

Your answer: one big difference between arrays and strings are the bracket notation that is used. for strings you use "" and for arrays you use []. other difference would be string and arrays do both use zero indexing. string and arrays also dont take the same data types. arrays can hold numbers, srings. strings really hold more text in quotes. strings and arrays also dont use the same built in methods. 

Researched answer: Similarities:
Sequential Data Structures: Both arrays and strings are sequential data structures, meaning they store a collection of elements or characters in a specific order.

Zero-based Indexing: Both arrays and strings use zero-based indexing, where the first element or character is accessed using index 0, the second using index 1, and so on.

Length Property: Both arrays and strings have a length property that indicates the number of elements in the array or the number of characters in the string.

Iterable: Both arrays and strings can be iterated over using loops or iteration methods like forEach, for...of, or map.

Differences:
Mutable vs. Immutable: Arrays are mutable, meaning you can change the elements they contain, add new elements, or remove existing ones. Strings, on the other hand, are immutable, meaning once created, their content cannot be changed. You can create a new string by modifying an existing one, but you cannot directly modify the original string.

Data Type: Arrays can hold elements of any data type, including numbers, strings, objects, or even other arrays. Strings, however, are specifically designed to hold sequences of characters.

Methods and Operations: Arrays have various built-in methods and operations for manipulating their elements, such as push, pop, splice, concat, etc. Strings have methods specific to string manipulation, such as charAt, indexOf, substring, split, slice, etc.

Representation: Arrays are represented by square brackets [ ], while strings are represented by quotes, either single (' ') or double (" ").

Memory Allocation: Arrays typically allocate memory for each element separately, while strings might use various techniques like string interning or storage optimizations to manage memory more efficiently.

4. STRETCH: What are the four pillars of object oriented programming?

Researched answer: The Four pillars of OOPs, abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Unit

Research and define the following terms. Hint: use the syllabus!

1. Objects: Objects are a JavaScript data type that has collections of key:value pairs. Objects can contain static information as well as actions in the form of methods. This makes objects the intersection of data and behavior.

2. Classes: Classes are the blueprint or templates for objects. Classes are reusable and customizable, much like functions.

3. React: React is JavaScript library for creating user interfaces. Everything in React is a component. React components are independent and reusable pieces of code. Each component contains its own functionality and returns markup.
